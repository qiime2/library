# QIIME 2 Library

The [QIIME 2 Library](https://library.qiime2.org) provides a means for QIIME 2 developers to host their plugins and for QIIME 2 users to discover new plugins.

## Adding a plugin to the library
To add a plugin to the library, please consult the docs [here](https://develop.qiime2.org/en/latest/plugins/how-to-guides/distribute-on-library.html).

## Developing the QIIME 2 Library


To host the app locally, first install the dependencies (while in the root of the repo):

```
npm install
```

Then run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will host the app on `localhost:5173` by default.

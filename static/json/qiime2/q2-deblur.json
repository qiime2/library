The stats are not automatically collected, and must be enabled with --p-sample-stats; they are not enabled automatically as their collection will come at a runtime cost. We may revisit whether to make them automatic in the future. For the time being, even if sample stats are not requested, an empty .qza file will be produced as there isn’t a means at the moment for optional QIIME2 method outputs."

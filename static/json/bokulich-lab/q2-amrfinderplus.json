The underlying tool used is [AMRFinderPlus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/antimicrobial-resistance/AMRFinder/), for details on\nthe package, please refer to the [AMRFinderPlus documentation](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki)). Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/bokulich-lab/q2-amrfinderplus/wiki) for usage examples of _q2-amrfinderplus_.\n\n| Action                 | Description                                                                                |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| fetch-amrfinderplus-db | Download AMRFinderPlus database.                                                           |\n| annotate               | Annotate protein sequences, MAGs or contigs with antimicrobial resistance gene information.|\n\n## Dev environment\nThis repository follows the _black_ code style. To make the development slightly easier\nthere are a couple of pre-commit hooks included here that will ensure that your changes\nfollow that formatting style. Before you start working on the code, please\ninstall the hooks by executing `make dev` in your conda environment. From then on,\nthey will be run automatically every time you commit any changes.\n",
